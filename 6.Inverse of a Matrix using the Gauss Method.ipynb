        "\n",
        "The Gauss-Jordan elimination method is used to find the inverse of a matrix by transforming the matrix into the identity matrix. If the matrix can be reduced to the identity matrix, then the matrix is invertible, and the inverse is formed by the matrix transformed during the process.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Write the Augmented Matrix**:\n",
        "   Start with the matrix $A$ and augment it with the identity matrix $I$ of the same size:\n",

        "   - Swap two rows.\n",

        "   - Add or subtract multiples of one row to/from another row.\n",
        "\n",
