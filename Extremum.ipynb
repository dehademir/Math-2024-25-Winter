        "## 1. What is Extremum?\n",
        "Extremum points of a function are the points where the function takes a local maximum or minimum value. These points are often where the graph of the function changes direction.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Local Maximum**: A point where the function value is higher than all other nearby points.\n",
        "- **Local Minimum**: A point where the function value is lower than all other nearby points.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. First Derivative\n",
        "To find extremum points, we first compute the first derivative of the function. The derivative of a function helps us understand its rate of change (or slope).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**\n",
        "Given function: $ f(x) = -x^2 + 6x + 2 $\n",
        "\n",
        "First derivative:\n",
        "$\n",
        "f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(-x^2 + 6x + 2) = -2x + 6\n",
        "$\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Why Set the Derivative Equal to 0?**\n",
        "- At the point where the function has a maximum or minimum, the tangent to the curve is horizontal. This means the derivative (slope) is 0.\n",
        "- So, we set $ f'(x) = 0 $ to find **critical points**.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Critical Points\n",
        "Critical points are the points where the first derivative equals zero. These points can be where the function has a maximum or minimum value.\n",

        "- **If $ f''(x) > 0 $**, the function is **concave up** (shaped like a cup), and the point is a **local minimum**.\n",
