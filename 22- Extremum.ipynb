        "## 1. What is Extremum?\n",
        "Extremum points of a function are the points where the function takes a local maximum or minimum value. These points are often where the graph of the function changes direction.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Local Maximum**: A point where the function value is higher than all other nearby points.\n",
        "- **Local Minimum**: A point where the function value is lower than all other nearby points.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. First Derivative\n",
        "To find extremum points, we first compute the first derivative of the function. The derivative of a function helps us understand its rate of change (or slope).\n",

        "- At the point where the function has a maximum or minimum, the tangent to the curve is horizontal. This means the derivative (slope) is 0.\n",
