        "#### 1. Introduction to the Gauss Method\n",
        "The **Gauss Method** (or Gaussian Elimination) is a method used to simplify a matrix into a form where the determinant can be easily calculated. The goal is to transform the matrix into an upper triangular form using a series of row operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Row Operations:\n",
        "The following row operations can be performed without changing the determinant:\n",
        "1. **Swapping two rows**: The determinant changes sign.\n",
        "2. **Multiplying a row by a scalar**: The determinant is multiplied by that scalar.\n",
        "3. **Adding a multiple of one row to another**: The determinant remains unchanged.\n",
