        "# Determinants using Laplace's Expansion\n",
        "\n",
        "Laplace's expansion (or cofactor expansion) is a systematic method to compute the determinant of a square matrix, especially useful for matrices larger than $3 \\times 3$. This method expresses the determinant of a matrix as a sum of smaller determinants, recursively breaking down the problem. The method is named after Pierre-Simon Laplace, who introduced it in the 19th century.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### General Formula for Laplace’s Expansion\n",
        "\n",
        "Given a square matrix $ A = [a_{ij}] $, where $ a_{ij} $ represents the element at the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of $A$, the determinant can be expanded along any row or column. The general formula for Laplace's expansion along the $i$-th row is:\n",
        "\n",
        "$\n",
        "\\text{det}(A) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} (-1)^{i+j} a_{ij} \\text{det}(A_{ij})\n",
        "$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "- $a_{ij}$ is the element of the matrix at position $(i, j)$.\n",
        "- $A_{ij}$ is the $(n-1) \\times (n-1)$ submatrix formed by deleting the $i$-th row and $j$-th column of $A$.\n",
        "- $(-1)^{i+j}$ is the sign factor which alternates in a checkerboard pattern (positive or negative).\n",
        "- $\\text{det}(A_{ij})$ is the determinant of the submatrix $A_{ij}$.\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, you are calculating the determinant of the matrix by breaking it down into smaller determinants, specifically those of $(n-1) \\times (n-1)$ matrices.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step-by-Step Process\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Choose a Row or Column:**\n",
        "   You can expand along any row or column, but it is usually efficient to choose the one with the most zeros to minimize the number of calculations. For simplicity, we often expand along the first row, but the result is the same no matter which row or column you select.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Compute Cofactors:**\n",
        "   The cofactor of an element $a_{ij}$ is computed as $(-1)^{i+j} \\text{det}(A_{ij})$, where $A_{ij}$ is the submatrix obtained by deleting the $i$-th row and $j$-th column.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Sum the Products:**\n",
        "   Once the cofactors are computed for each element in the row or column, multiply each element by its corresponding cofactor and sum them up to get the determinant of the matrix.\n",
